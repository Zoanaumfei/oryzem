# Oryzem — Starter

This repository contains a minimal starter for a plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.

Files added:
- `index.html` — entry page
- `src/css/styles.css` — basic styles
- `src/js/main.js` — small JavaScript example
- `package.json` — convenience scripts
- `.gitignore` — ignore `node_modules`

Run locally (choose one):

- Open directly in your browser: double-click `index.html` or right-click -> Open with Browser.
- Use Node (requires Node.js / npm):

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

- Use Python (if you have Python installed):

```powershell
# runs a simple HTTP server on port 8000
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes for contributors:
- This is an intentionally minimal scaffold. If you'd like a build tool (Webpack/Vite), tests, or CI, ask first or open a PR that documents the added files and commands.
